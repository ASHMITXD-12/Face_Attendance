# Face_Attendance
Face Recognition Attendance System Project using Python
The main purpose of this project is to build a face recognition-based attendance monitoring system for educational institutions to enhance and upgrade the current attendance system into more efficient and effective as compared to before. The current old system has a lot of ambiguity that causes inaccurate and inefficient attendance taking. Many problems arise when the authority is unable to enforce the regulations that exist in the old system. The technology working behind will be the face recognition system. The human face is one of the natural traits that can uniquely identify an individual.


Therefore, it is used to trace identity as the possibilities for a face to deviate or be duplicated is low. In this project, face databases will be created to pump data into the recognizer algorithm. Then, during the attendance taking session, faces will be compared against the database to seek for identity. When an individual is identified, their attendance will be taken down automatically, saving necessary information in a csv file.
